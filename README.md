# AI-Router  
**An Experimental AI Integration Platform**

## 📌 Overview  
AI-Router is an innovative platform designed to function as an **AI model router**, enabling seamless communication between multiple AI systems like **OpenAI, DeepSeek, and others**.  
The goal is to create a **Universal AI Router** that can manage and coordinate different AI models, allowing for **dynamic AI interactions and interoperability**.  

Inspired by **network routers**, this project **routes AI-generated queries and responses** between different AI models instead of handling network packets.

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)  
- **Multi-AI Model Routing** – Directs queries to the most suitable AI model based on predefined logic.  
- **Cross-Model Communication** – Enables AI systems to collaborate and generate enhanced responses.  
- **Configurable Intelligence & Emotion Settings** – Allows dynamic control of AI behavior.  
- **Scalable Architecture** – Designed to integrate additional AI models seamlessly.  
- **API-First Design** – Provides a developer-friendly way to connect with various AI models.

## 🔨 What We've Done So Far  
AI-Router has progressed through several development stages, and we have implemented the following:  

- ✅ **Designed the core architecture** to route AI-generated queries.  
- ✅ **Integrated support for OpenAI and DeepSeek models** for proof of concept.  
- ✅ **Implemented a working API** that allows seamless switching between models.  
- ✅ **Optimized response handling** to improve latency and efficiency.  

This is just the beginning—many more features are planned! 🚀
