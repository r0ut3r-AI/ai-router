# AI-Router  
**An Experimental AI Integration Platform**

## 📌 Overview  
AI-Router is an innovative platform designed to function as an **AI model router**, enabling seamless communication between multiple AI systems like **OpenAI, DeepSeek, and others**.  
The goal is to create a **Universal AI Router** that can manage and coordinate different AI models, allowing for **dynamic AI interactions and interoperability**.  

Inspired by **network routers**, this project **routes AI-generated queries and responses** between different AI models instead of handling network packets.  

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)  
- **Multi-AI Model Routing** – Directs queries to the most suitable AI model based on predefined logic.  
- **Cross-Model Communication** – Enables AI systems to collaborate and generate enhanced responses.  
- **Configurable Intelligence & Emotion Settings** – Allows dynamic control of AI behavior.  
- **Scalable Architecture** – Designed to integrate additional AI models seamlessly.  
- **API-First Design** – Provides a developer-friendly way to connect with various AI models.  

## 🚀 Current Development Status  
### Prototype Stage  
The project is currently in its early development phase, focusing on:  
- Designing a **modular architecture** for AI routing.  
- Experimenting with different **model coordination techniques**.  
- Testing **latency, performance, and interoperability**.  

### Ongoing Research & Exploration  
- Identifying **real-world use cases** for AI integration.  
- Evaluating **performance optimizations and response handling**.  
- Exploring **security measures** for AI model interactions.  

## 📅 Future Roadmap  
- Implement **real-time AI decision-making logic**.  
- Develop a **management dashboard** for AI routing configurations.  
- Enhance **compatibility with more AI models**.  
- Optimize **latency and efficiency** for large-scale interactions.
